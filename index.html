        <h2>Welcome to Little Ciao</h2>
        <p>
Established in 2016, Little Ciao began as a dream shared by two friends who wanted to bring the taste of authentic Italian street food to their community. With just a small kitchen and a big passion for flavor, they started serving fresh pasta, paninis, and espresso to locals who quickly fell in love with the food — and the friendly atmosphere.
Word spread fast, and what started as a humble eatery became a local favorite. Today, Little Ciao stands as a celebration of Italian culture and community — where every meal is made from the heart, and every guest is greeted with a warm “ciao.”
